    "If you've been looking closely in the image directories, you may notice that some images have a .bad suffix rather than the .pgm suffix. As it turns out, 16 of the 640 images taken have glitches due to problems with the camera setup; these are the .bad images. Some people had more glitches than others, but everyone who got ``faced'' should have at least 28 good face images (out of the 32 variations possible, discounting scale). "
